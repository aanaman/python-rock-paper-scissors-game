# Python Rock Paper Scissors Game Project
Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Project using Python to create a Rock Paper Scissors game

## Project Specifications
* Paper beats rock; rock beats scissors; scissors beat paper.
* The game displays the results after each round, including each player's score. At the end, the final score is displayed.
* The game has (at least) four computer player strategies:
   * A player that always plays 'rock'
   * A player that chooses its moves randomly.
   * A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round.
   * A player that cycles through the three moves
* The game calls each player's move method once in each round, to get that player's move. After each round, it calls the remembering method to tell each player what the other player's move was.
